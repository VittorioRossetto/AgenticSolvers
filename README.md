# AgenticSolvers
The idea of this research is based on a novel paradigm for solving complex, NP-hard problems (e.g., schedul- ing, routing) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as dynamic orchestrators in Agentic solvers, as proposed in a position Paper by professor Roberto Amadini and Simone Gazza.
